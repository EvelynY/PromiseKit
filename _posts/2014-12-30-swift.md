# Swift

To integrate Swift PromiseKit, choose one of these options:

1. Use CocoaPods 0.36 and `pod "PromiseKit/Swift"`
2. Use Carthage and `github "mxcl/PromiseKit"`
3. Drag and drop PromiseKit.xcodeproj into your project. Clone `OMGHTTPURLRQ` and add its xcodeproj. Add both frameworks to your embedded binaries section in your project settings.

# Swift Documentation

Currently the Swift version is undocumented. The Swift version is “complete” but I am waiting on newer versions of Xcode before I commit entirely to its API, so I still consider it a work-in-progress.

The xcodeproj itself contains an example Swift app with promises.

## Using objc PromiseKit in Swift Projects

It seems that you cannot use Objective C promises in Swift projects. At least I cannot make this compile:

{% highlight swift %}
let promise = PMKPromise(value: true)
let then = promise.then() as (AnyObject) -> PMKPromise!
then({ (Bool)->Void in
    // won't compile
})
{% endhighlight %}

I think there is some detail in that Objective-C blocks are not exactly the same as Swift closures. And since the API for PMKPromise does not explicitly define the parameter for `then`, it will not convert.

Even if you could do this, it would be pretty ugly due to Objective C PromiseKit returning a block that takes a block to facilitate the dot-notation.
